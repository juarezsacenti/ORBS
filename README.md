# ORBS: Ontology-based Recommender Systems

ORBS is a toolkit for development, evaluation and comparison of ontology-based recommender systems that models user profiles with multi-hierarchies about factors of interest. This page contains information on how to work with the ORBS code and how to compile ORBS. If you have not used ORBS before, do check out the Getting Started guide.

The current main reference article for referring to ORBS in general is "Hybrid Recommender System based on Multi-Hierarchical Ontologies" published in 2018 in the Proceedings of the 24th Brazilian Symposium on Multimedia and the Web (WebMedia'18).

ORBS is made available under <Apache?> License, Version 2.0.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

TODO What things you need to install the software and how to install them
Java Version


### Installing

Installing Apache PredictionIO from Source using Eclipse

#### Download Source Code

```
Give the example
```

#### Installing Dependencies

ORBS is built and deployed via Maven. In order to install it, check out this repository and run mvn install. This will make it available for other Maven projects as a dependency.

```
Give the example
```

#### Storage Setup

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

## Running the examples

TODO Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
